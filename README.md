### Hi there, I'm Zoe! 👋
🌱&emsp;I’m a MSDS student at University of San Francisco.<br>
📚&emsp;I love learning and applying what I’ve learned to solve problems. You can see some of my projects here and my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiT66aj2Zh_GOyhYuud0Iog)!<br>
✨&emsp;Pronouns: she/her<br>
🎈&emsp;In my free time: I enjoy reading books, taking leisurely walks in gardens to connect with nature, playing music, and occasionally playing games.🌻<br>
